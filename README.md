Simple application to detect when your internet is offline. 
Would be usefull in cases if you have laggy internet 
connection and whant to check how laggy it is...

Checks if application can access google.com and yahoo.com every 8 seconds and if it cannot logs it in log.txt
Provides offline time count in multiples of 8 sec.

Checks multiple hosts so it is fail safe in cases if one of them gose down

I will fix this in future to check multiple hosts

To launch application:

    1. type in console: npm install
    2. type in console npm start
